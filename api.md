Ninchat API Reference
=====================

This document describes version 2 of the open [Ninchat](https://ninchat.com)
API.  It will be extended over time, without causing regressions to conforming
client applications.  If a new, backward-incompatible API version is released,
it will be accessible using new network endpoints.

Changes
=======

### Version 2

Backward-incompatible changes from version 1:

- [WebSocket](#websocket) clients must be prepared to handle text and binary
  frames.  (Previously only text frames were sent to clients.)

- The initial value of the `action_id` parameter must be 1 (instead of any
  positive integer), and it must be reset to 1 when a new session is created
  and there are no action retries queued from previous sessions.  (See the
  [Interface](#interface) section.)

- The `ninchat.com/info` message type is split into multiple
  [`ninchat.com/info/*`](#ninchatcominfo) types.

- Message content must consist of at least one part.  (See the
  [`send_message`](#send_message) action.)

- The [`message_received`](#message_received) event might not include the
  message content.

- The `message_time` parameter type changed from integer to float.  (See the
  [`message_received`](#message_received) event.)

- The [`search_results`](#search_results) event's "users" and "channels"
  objects were modified to accommodate more parameters.

- The [`session_created`](#session_created) event might not include the
  `session_host` parameter.

- The WebSocket-Protocol header is now unversioned; the API version is included
  in the [WebSocket](#websocket) endpoint URL.

See the [commit log](https://github.com/ninchat/ninchat-api/commits/v2/api.md)
for incremental changes.


Interface
=========

Clients send actions to the server, which sends events to clients.  Action and
event parameter values are represented as JSON types.

Most actions support or require the `action_id` parameter, which may be used to
detect success or failure of the action.  The action reference indicates the
exceptions when it is *not* supported.  When the client receives (at least) one
event with the corresponding `action_id`, the action has succeeded, unless
the event was `error`.  The values should be ascending integers, starting at 1,
over the lifetime of the client instance's state (even across sessions).  If no
response event is received, the client may retry the action (e.g. after
reconnecting) with the same `action_id` value.

Most actions support the `puppet_id` parameter.  The action reference indicates
the exceptions when it is *not* supported.  See the
[Ninchat Puppets](puppet.md) document for more information.

In addition to the parameters listed below, most events contain the
monotonically ascending `event_id` integer parameter (starting at 1).  Such
events are buffered by the server until they are acknowledged by the client, so
that they can be retransmitted if the network connection is lost during a
session.  (Events without an `event_id` are connection-specific.)  The
acknowledgement procedure is transport-specific (see
[Streaming Transports](#streaming-transports)).  Failure to acknowledge events
results in session buffer overflow.

Instead of the reply events listed below, any action may cause an `error`
event.

Undefined action, event and parameter names must not be used in communication
and you should not rely on their nonexistence.  Enumerations
(e.g. `access_type`, `error_type` and `identity_type`) may gain new options, so
clients should be able to cope with events with unknown values for such
parameters.

When a newer API version is available, a client accessing an old API endpoint
may receive an unsolicited `error` event with error_type set to `deprecated`.
(It's purely informational, and doesn't necessarily imply immediate service
degradation.)


Actions
-------

### `create_session`

- `user_id` : string (optional)
- `user_auth` : string (optional)
- `user_attrs` : object (optional)
- `user_settings` : object (optional)
- `user_metadata` : object (optional)
- `identity_type` : string (optional)
- `identity_name` : string (optional)
- `identity_auth` : string (optional)
- `identity_type_new` : string (optional)
- `identity_name_new` : string (optional)
- `identity_auth_new` : string (optional)
- `identity_attrs` : object (optional)
- `access_key` : string (optional)
- `master_key_type` : string (optional)
- `master_sign` : string (optional)
- `puppet_attrs` : object (optional)
- `message_types` : string array

Exceptions:

- `puppet_id` is not supported.
- `session_id` is not supported (see [Streaming Transports](#streaming-transports)).

Reply event: [`session_created`](#session_created)

There are five modes of operation:

1. If `user_id` and `user_auth` are specified, a new session for an existing
   user is created.

2. If `identity_type`, `identity_name` and `identity_auth` are specified, a new
   session for an existing user is created.  The identity type and name must be
   verified for a user.

   If `identity_type` is set to "facebook", `identity_name` is set to a
   Facebook user id and `identity_auth` contains a matching signed request, a
   session is created for the existing Ninchat user with the associated
   Facebook identity.

3. If `access_key` is specified, a new session for an existing user is created.
   The access key configuration determines the user.

4. If `user_id` and `master_sign` are specified, a new session for an existing
   user is created.  `master_key_type` specifies the signature type (defaults
   to "ninchat").  An `access_expired` error type is returned if the signature
   has expired.  See [Action signatures](master.md#action-signatures).

5. Otherwise a new user is created.

   The user will be a guest unless the `guest` user attribute is explicitly set
   as false.

   `identity_type_new`, `identity_name_new`, `identity_auth_new` and/or
   `identity_attrs` may be used to create an identity for the user.

   If `identity_type_new` is set to "facebook", `identity_name_new` is set to a
   Facebook user id and `identity_auth_new` contains a matching signed request
   from the Facebook SDK, the Facebook identity is associated with the created
   Ninchat user.

Accepted message types are specified as a list of strings to compare against
incoming message types.  If a string ends with an asterisk (\*), the substring
preceding the asterisk is used to match prefixes instead of whole strings.  The
"*" string accepts all messages.  An empty array rejects all messages.

If the authentication token or access key is invalid or has been revoked, the
error type will be `access_denied`.  This condition is permanent:
`create_session` won't succeed later with the same parameters.


### `resume_session`

Exceptions:

- `puppet_id` is not supported

Receive or acknowledge events of an existing session.  See
[Streaming Transports](#streaming-transports) for details.


### `update_session`

- `session_idle` : boolean (optional)
- `channel_id` : string (optional)
- `user_id` : string (optional)
- `message_id` : string (optional)

Exceptions:

- `puppet_id` is not supported.

Client-assisted idle user and unread message tracking.


### `close_session`

Exceptions:

- `puppet_id` is not supported.

See [Streaming Transports](#streaming-transports) for details.


### `create_user`

- `action_id` : integer
- `user_attrs` : string (optional)
- `user_settings` : string (optional)
- `puppet_attrs` : object (optional)

Reply event: [`user_created`](#user_created)

Like [`create_session`](#create_session), but doesn't create a session.  Useful
with the [sessionless API](#sessionless-http-calling).

If called by an existing user (e.g. there is a session, or the caller is
authenticated), the created user will become a puppet of the calling (master)
user.  The [`user_created`](#user_created) event won't include the `user_auth`
parameter; instead, the puppet user may be logged in and manipulated using the
master key mechanism.

If called without a session or authentication credentials, a standalone user is
created.  The [`user_created`](#user_created) event will include the
`user_auth` parameter.

The created user will be a guest unless the `guest` user attribute is
explicitly set as false.


### `describe_user`

- `action_id` : integer
- `user_id` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`user_found`](#user_found)


### `update_user`

- `action_id` : integer
- `user_attrs` : object (optional)
- `user_settings` : object (optional)
- `payload_attrs` : string array (optional)

Reply event: [`user_updated`](#user_updated)

The `iconurl` attribute may be set by uploading image data in the payload: the
index of the payload frame is determined by the index of the "icon" string in
the `payload_attrs` array.  WebSocket example:

First frame:

	{
	  "action":        "update_user",
	  "action_id":     3,
	  "payload_attrs": ["icon"],
	  "frames":        1
	}

Second frame:

	\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n\x00\x00\x00\rIHDR\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x01\x01\x03
	\x00\x00\x00%\xdbV\xca\x00\x00\x00\x03PLTE\x93c+\xbaC\xfaW\x00\x00\x00\nIDA
	T\x08\xd7c`\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x01\xe2!\xbc3\x00\x00\x00\x00IEND\xaeB`\x82

If the uploaded image data cannot be converted to an icon, the
`file_not_supported` error is returned.


### `delete_user`

- `action_id` : integer
- `user_auth` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`user_deleted`](#user_deleted)

The `user_auth` token must be repeated here to avoid accidents and mischief,
except for guest users, or when this action is invoked with `puppet_id`.


### `create_identity`

- `action_id` : integer
- `identity_type` : string
- `identity_name` : string
- `identity_attrs` : object (optional)
- `identity_auth_new` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`identity_created`](#identity_created)

Associates an identity with the session user.  The identity is pending
verification until futher action is taken.

Identity types:

- "email" sends an email with a verification link.  `identity_name` specifies
  the email address.
- "facebook" creates an identity to be used for authentication with the help of
  the Facebook SDK.  See `create_session`.
- "gcm" registers a GCM id.  `identity_name` specifies the GCM registration id.
- "apns" registers an APNs id.  `identity_name` specifies the APNs device id.

A secret authentication token (password) is associated with the identity if
`identity_auth_new` is specified.


### `create_identity_with_auth_reset_access`

- `action_id` : integer
- `identity_type` : string
- `identity_name` : string
- `identity_attrs` : object (optional)

Reply event: [`identity_created`](#identity_created)

Combines the [`create_identity`](#create_identity) and
[`request_identity_auth_reset_access`](#request_identity_auth_reset_access)
actions: password is not set by the action, but via a link received in an
email.  The identity will be verified when a password is set (via the link).


### `request_identity_verify_access`

- `action_id` : integer (optional)
- `identity_type` : string
- `identity_name` : string

Exceptions:

- `session_id` is optional (see [Streaming Transports](#streaming-transports)).

Reply event: `access_created` (without `access_key`)

Resend an email identity verification link if the identity is still pending
verification.  (In other words, `identity_type` must be "email" for now.)


### `verify_identity`

- `action_id` : integer (optional)
- `access_key` : string
- `identity_accept` : boolean

Exceptions:

- `session_id` is optional (see [Streaming Transports](#streaming-transports)).

Reply event: [`identity_updated`](#identity_updated)

Accepts or rejects a pending user identity.


### `describe_identity`

- `action_id` : integer
- `identity_type` : string
- `identity_name` : string

Reply event: [`identity_found`](#identity_found)


### `update_identity`

- `action_id` : integer
- `identity_type` : string

Reply event: [`identity_updated`](#identity_updated)


### `update_identity_auth`

- `action_id` : integer
- `identity_type` : string
- `identity_name` : string
- `identity_auth` : string (optional)
- `identity_auth_new` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`identity_updated`](#identity_updated)

Sets or changes the secret authentication token (password).

`identity_auth` (the old authentication token) must be specified if the
identity already has one.  It will be replaced with `identity_auth_new`.  If
`identity_auth_new` is not specified, the password will be removed.


### `request_identity_auth_reset_access`

- `action_id` : integer (optional)
- `identity_type` : string
- `identity_name` : string

Exceptions:

- `session_id` is optional (see [Streaming Transports](#streaming-transports)).

Reply event: [`access_created`](#access_created) (without `access_key`)

Create and send an access key to the specified email address if it's a verified
email identity.  (In other words, `identity_type` must be "email" for now.)
The access key may be used to reset the password associated with the identity.


### `reset_identity_auth`

- `access_key` : string
- `identity_auth_new` : string

Exceptions:

- `session_id` is optional (see [Streaming Transports](#streaming-transports)).

Reply event: [`identity_updated`](#identity_updated)

Resets the authentication token (password) associated with an identity
(specified by the `access_key`).


### `delete_identity`

- `action_id` : integer
- `identity_type` : string
- `identity_name` : string
- `identity_auth` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`identity_deleted`](#identity_deleted)

`identity_auth` must be specified if the identity has one.


### `update_dialogue`

- `action_id` : integer
- `user_id` : string
- `member_attrs` : object (optional)
- `dialogue_status` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`dialogue_updated`](#dialogue_updated)

Update your own member attributes in your dialogue with `user_id`, or your
perceived status of the dialogue.  Valid values for `dialogue_status` are
"visible" (not hidden, not highlighted) and "hidden".


### `create_channel`

- `action_id` : integer
- `channel_attrs` : object (optional)
- `realm_id` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`channel_joined`](#channel_joined)

If `realm_id` is specified, the realm owner will become the channel owner.
Otherwise the session user will become the owner.


### `describe_channel`

- `action_id` : integer
- `channel_id` : string

Reply event: [`channel_found`](#channel_found)


### `update_channel`

- `action_id` : integer
- `channel_id` : string
- `channel_attrs` : object

Reply event: [`channel_updated`](#channel_updated)


### `delete_channel`

- `action_id` : integer
- `channel_id` : string

Reply event: [`channel_deleted`](#channel_deleted)

The channel must be suspended before it can be deleted.


### `follow_channel`

- `action_id` : integer
- `channel_id` : string
- `master_key_type` : string (optional)
- `master_sign` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`channel_found`](#channel_found)

Like [`join_channel`](#join_channel), but:

- May only be used with channels with the `disclosed_since` and `followable`
  attributes set, and without the `private` attribute set.  Note: channels in
  realms may be followable even when the `public` attribute is not set!
- The user won't appear on the channel's member list.
- The user won't be able to send messages to the channel.
- Only the session which invoked this action will receive `message_received`
  events for this channel.
- The user will stop following the channel when the session is closed.


### `join_channel`

- `action_id` : integer
- `channel_id` : string (optional)
- `access_key` : string (optional)
- `master_key_type` : string (optional)
- `master_sign` : string (optional)
- `member_attrs` : object (optional)

Reply events: [`channel_joined`](#channel_joined) and
              [`realm_joined`](#realm_joined) (if applicable)

There are three modes of operation:

1. `channel_id` specifies the channel to be joined.  It must not be in a realm
   or it must be in one of the user's realms.

2. `access_key` grants permission to join a channel in a realm.  The access key
   configuration determines the channel to be joined.  The
   [`realm_joined`](#realm_joined) event indicates that the user was granted
   access to the channel's realm in addition to the channel (depending on the
   access key configuration).

3. `master_sign` grants permission to join the channel.  `master_key_type`
   specifies the signature type (defaults to "ninchat").  See
   [Action signatures](master.md#action-signatures).

`member_attrs` can only be specified in conjunction with `master_sign`, when
`master_key_type` is "ninchat" (see [Ninchat Master Keys](master.md)).  It can
only be used to disable the "silenced" member attribute, when the channel has
"autosilence" attribute enabled.


### `part_channel`

- `action_id` : integer
- `channel_id` : string

Reply event: [`channel_parted`](#channel_parted)

If the parting user was the last member and the channel is not associated with
an audience queue, the channel will be deleted immediately.

If the parting user was the last member of an audience channel, the channel
will be suspened.  The channel will persit without members until
`delete_channel` is called, or it is deleted automatically according to a
schedule.


### `create_realm`

- `action_id` : integer
- `realm_attrs` : object (optional)
- `realm_settings` : object (optional)
- `channel_attrs` : object (optional)

Reply events: [`realm_joined`](#realm_joined) and
              [`channel_joined`](#channel_joined) (if applicable)

Creates a realm, and an optional initial channel if `channel_attrs` is defined.
The session user will become the owner of both.


### `describe_realm`

- `action_id` : integer
- `realm_id` : string

Reply event: [`realm_found`](#realm_found)


### `describe_realm_queues`

- `action_id` : integer
- `realm_id` : string
- `queue_ids` : string array (optional)
- `track_stage` : string (optional)
- `track_metadata` : object (optional)

Reply event: [`realm_queues_found`](#realm_queues_found)

Describe some or all audience queues of a realm.  The session will continue to
receive additional [`queue_updated`](#queue_updated) events if there are
changes to the queues.  The updates will cease after an audience is requested
through one of the queues.

If specified, `queue_ids` indicates a subset of the realm's queues which the
user is interested in.  Unknown queue ids are silently ignored.  (The user may
still receive spurious `queue_updated` events concerning the realm's other
queues.)


### `update_realm`

- `action_id` : integer
- `realm_id` : string
- `realm_attrs` : object (optional)
- `realm_settings` : object (optional)

Reply event: [`realm_updated`](#realm_updated)


### `delete_realm`

- `action_id` : integer
- `realm_id` : string

Reply event: [`realm_deleted`](#realm_deleted)


### `create_queue`

- `action_id` : integer
- `realm_id` : string
- `queue_attrs` : object

Reply event: [`queue_created`](#queue_created)

Create a new audience queue.  Caller must be a realm operator.


### `update_queue`

- `action_id` : integer
- `queue_id` : string
- `queue_attrs` : object (optional)
- `queue_settings` : object (optional)

Reply event: [`queue_updated`](#queue_updated)

Update audience queue attributes and/or settings.  Caller must be a realm
operator.


### `delete_queue`

- `action_id` : integer
- `queue_id` : string

Reply event: [`queue_deleted`](#queue_deleted)

Delete an audience queue.  Caller must be a realm operator.


### `describe_queue`

- `action_id` : integer
- `queue_id` : string

Reply event: [`queue_found`](#queue_found)

Describe an audience queue.


### `request_audience`

- `action_id` : integer
- `queue_id` : string
- `audience_metadata` : object (optional)

Reply event: [`audience_enqueued`](#audience_enqueued)

Go to the end of the queue.

The `audience_metadata` object may contain arbitrary properties, but the
"secure" property is special: if set to a string value, it will be decrypted
using the queue owner's master key, and the contents will be set as the value
of the property.  Other value types for "secure" property are rejected.  A
`permission_expired` error type is returned if the encrypted metadata has
expired.  See [Secure metadata](master.md#secure-metadata).

When the audience is accepted, the user will automatically join a channel or a
dialogue will start, depending on queue configuration.  `audience_id` and
`queue_id` will be set either as channel attributes, or as dialogue member
attributes for the session user.


### `accept_audience`

- `action_id` : integer
- `queue_id` : string
- `audience_id` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`channel_joined`](#channel_joined) or [`dialogue_updated`](#dialogue_updated)

Take the next user or the specific audience (if `audience_id` is specified)
from the queue.  Caller must be a queue member.

Either a channel or a dialogue will be created, depending on queue
configuration.  The channel attributes or the accepted user's dialogue
membership attributes will contain `audience_id` and `queue_id`.


### `transfer_audience`

- `action_id` : integer
- `audience_id` : string
- `queue_id` : string

Reply event: [`channel_parted`](#channel_parted)

End a previously accepted audience, and enqueue the customer to another queue.


### `add_member`

- `action_id` : integer
- `realm_id` : string (optional)
- `queue_id` : string (optional)
- `user_id` : string

Reply event: [`realm_member_joined`](#realm_member_joined) or [`queue_member_joined`](#queue_member_joined)

Causes a specific user to join a realm or an audience queue.  Caller must be a
realm opereator.


### `update_member`

- `action_id` : integer
- `channel_id` : string (optional)
- `realm_id` : string (optional)
- `user_id` : string
- `member_attrs` : object
- `interval_end` : float (optional)

Reply event: [`channel_member_updated`](#channel_member_updated) or
             [`realm_member_updated`](#realm_member_updated)

Sets or clears a channel or realm membership attributes for a user.

If `interval_end` is specified with a channel membership attribute, the set
attribute will be automatically unset at that time.  (An `update_member` call
with an interval can set only one attribute at a time.)


### `remove_member`

- `action_id` : integer
- `channel_id` : string (optional)
- `realm_id` : string (optional)
- `queue_id` : string (optional)
- `user_id` : string

Reply event: [`channel_member_parted`](#channel_member_parted),
             [`realm_member_parted`](#realm_member_parted) or
             [`queue_member_parted`](#queue_member_parted)

Kicks a user out of a channel, a realm or an audience queue.  Caller must be
the target user, a channel operator or moderator (if removing from a channel)
or a realm operator (if removing from a realm or a queue).


### `send_message`

- `action_id` : integer (optional)
- `channel_id` : string (optional)
- `user_id` : string (optional)
- `identity_type` : string (optional)
- `identity_name` : string (optional)
- `message_type` : string
- `message_recipient_ids` : string array (optional)
- `message_fold` : boolean (optional)
- `message_ttl` : float (optional)

Reply event: [`message_received`](#message_received) or none (if `action_id` is
             not specified)

Message content is provided in the payload (see
[Streaming Transports](#streaming-transports)).  The content may not be empty:
it must contain one or more parts (but the individual parts may be
zero-length).

Exactly one of `channel_id`, `user_id` and `identity_name` must be specified.
`user_id` specifies a private conversation party.  `identity_type` and
`identity_name` specify a private conversation party without an established
user account.

If `message_ttl` is specified, restrictions are placed on message delivery: the
message may not be stored in the channel/dialogue history and messages may be
dropped by unresponsive sessions.  `message_ttl` specifies the minimum time in
seconds to buffer the message (which should be the upper limit for the
usefulness of the content).  Sending such a message to an identity doesn't make
sense.


### `update_message`

- `action_id` : integer
- `channel_id` : string
- `message_id` : string
- `message_hidden` : boolean

Reply event: [`message_updated`](#message_updated)

Available for channel operators and moderators.  Affects a single message on
the channel.


### `update_user_messages`

- `action_id` : integer
- `channel_id` : string
- `message_user_id` : string
- `message_id` : string (optional)
- `interval_end` : float (optional)
- `message_hidden` : boolean

Reply event: [`message_updated`](#message_updated)

Available for channel operators and moderators.  Affects all messages up to and
including `message_id` which have been sent by `message_user_id` to the
channel.  `interval_end` may be used instead of `message_id` to specify the
(inclusive) end of time range.


### `load_history`

Reply events: [`history_results`](#history_results) and
              [`message_received`](#message_received) multiple times (with
              `history_length` set)

Exactly one of `channel_id` and `user_id` must be specified.  `user_id`
specifies a private conversation party.

`message_types` defaults to the value passed to `create_session`.

`message_id` makes it possible to fetch additional messages if you already have
some.  It specifies the exclusive first or last message identifier (depending
on the `history_order` parameter).  The latest messages are returned by
default.  Empty string indicates the beginning of history.

If `message_fold` is set, only folded messages are returned.

The meaning of `history_length` is as follows:

1. In the `load_history` action it specifies the number of requested messages.
2. In the `history_results` event it specifies the number of available
   messages.
3. In the `message_received` event it specifies the number of remaining
   messages.

`history_order` specifies the order in which the messages will be received.
When used in combination with `message_id`, its value also determines if we are
fetching older or newer messages:

- -1 requests newer messages first (descending).  `message_id` specifies the
  exclusive end of range.  This is the default.
- 1 requests older messages first (ascending).  `message_id` specifies the
  exclusive start of range.

If `filter_property` and `filter_substring` are specified, only messages which
contain the `filter_substring` in the value of their `filter_property` are
returned (if supported for the message type).  `message_types` should contain
only supported message types (see [Message Types](#message-types)); other
messages are ignored.  `history_length` specifies the number of returned
messages.


### `discard_history`

- `action_id` : integer (optional)
- `user_id` : string
- `message_id` : string

Reply event: [`history_discarded`](#history_discarded) (without

`user_id` specifies a private conversation party.  `message_id` specifies the
latest message to be discarded.


### `create_access`

- `access_type` : string
- `channel_id` : string (optional)
- `channel_unsilence` : boolean (optional)
- `realm_member` : boolean (optional)
- `user_id` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`access_created`](#access_created)

Creates an access key for use with [`create_session`](#create_session) or
[`join_channel`](#join_channel).

Access types:

- "session" keys may be used in `create_session` actions.
- "channel" keys may be used in a single `join_channel` action.  If
  `channel_unsilence` is true, the invited user will not be silenced even if
  the channel has the `autosilence` attribute set.  If `realm_member` is true,
  the invited user will also join the realm of the channel (if any).  If
  `user_id` is specified, the invite can only be used by that user, and an info
  message is sent to that user (see [Message types](#message-types)).


### `send_access`

- `action_id` : integer
- `access_key` : string (optional)
- `user_id` : string (optional)
- `identity_type` : string (optional)
- `identity_name` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`access_found`](#access_found)

Send a pre-created channel access key to a user (= invite).  There are three
modes of operation:

1. If `access_key` and `user_id` are specified, a `ninchat.com/info/*` message
   is sent to the user in a dialogue.
2. If `access_key`, `identity_type` and `identity_name` are specified, an email
   is sent.  (In other words, `identity_type` must be "email" for now.)
3. If `identity_type` and `identity_name` are specified without `access_key`,
   the (undisclosed) access key associated with the user's identity is used, if
   any.  (This is the verification-link-resend feature.)


### `describe_access`

- `realm_id` : string (optional)
- `master_key_type` : string (optional)
- `master_key_id` : string (optional)

Reply event: [`master_key_created`](#master_key_created)

If `realm_id` is not specified, the created key can be used with any resource
owned by the creator (to the extent supported by the API).  In particular,
puppet users can be created and controlled with such keys.

If `realm_id` is specified, the created key can only be used with resources
associated with that realm (e.g. channels and audience metadata).  Such keys
can be created and deleted by realm operators.

If `master_key_type` is "ninchat" or left unspecified, an id and a secret key
are generated automatically.

If `master_key_type` is "jwt", `master_key_id` must be specified, and the key
material must be provided in the payload.


### `delete_master_key`

- `action_id` : integer

Reply event: [`master_key_deleted`](#master_key_deleted)

`realm_id` must be specified if the key is associated with a realm.

If the key is not associated with a realm (= it's a personal key), either
`master_key_secret` or `user_auth` must be specified for extra safety.

`master_key_type` defaults to "ninchat".

Reply event: [`transcript_contents`](#transcript_contents)

Dump the "ninchat.com/*" messages sent on a channel, in a dialogue, or during
an audience.  `dialogue_id` holds a pair of user ids (the order doesn't
matter).

Specifying a time interval may make sense when targetting a long-lived channel.
By default the interval is the whole history.

There is an unspecified technical limit on the number of messages returned at
once.  `message_id` may be used to get more messages if an earlier call didn't
return everything.

List all dialogues which have started from the specified audience queue and
completed during the specified interval.  The interval may be open-ended, but
by default it will only return time slots which have already ended.  The
`interval_ongoing` parameter can be used to include unfinished transcripts of
the ongoing time slot.

may be used in a subsequent `get_transcript` call to get successive messages.

The `transcript_messages` array looks like this (the `message_user_id`,
`message_user_name` and `message_fold` properties are optional):

	"transcript_messages": [

		{
			"request_time":  1445592871.785086,
			"accept_time":   1445592877.183851,
			"finish_time":   1445592952.232474,

		}


### Puppet attributes

- `name` : string (writable by master)

	User name.


Settings
--------

Clients can set any settings for their purposes, but the ones listed here will
also enable specific server-side functionality.


### User settings

Users can update their own settings.

- `highlight` : string array

	Highlight words to match against channel message text.  If a string ends
    with an asterisk (\*), the substring preceding the asterisk is used to
    match word prefixes instead of whole words.

- `highlight_name` : boolean

	Makes the current user name attribute a highlight word, regardless of the
	value of the `highlight` setting.

- `notifications` : object

	Enables desktop, audio, email and GCM/APNS notifications for channel,
	hightlight and/or private messages:

		"notifications": {
			"highlight":        false,
			"highlight_audio":  false,
			"highlight_email":  false,
			"highlight_mobile": false,
			"private":          false,
			"private_audio":    false,
			"private_email":    false,
			"private_mobile":   false,
			"channel":          false,
			"channel_audio":    false,
			"channel_mobile":   false
		}

- `proto` : boolean

	The user has received messages (via email), but has not activated the user
	account.


### Realm settings

Realm operators can manipulate realm settings.

- `default_queue_settings` : object

	Specifies defaults for some queue settings.  Currently only the
	`transcript_delete_delay` setting is supported.


### Queue settings

Realm operators can manipulate queue settings.

- `audience_registration` : boolean

	Enables audience registration.

- `transcript_delete_delay` : integer

	If set, audience transcripts will be deleted automatically.  This setting
	indicates the number of seconds from audience completion to its deletion.
	When set, the setting will only apply to future audiences; it will not be
	applied to already completed audiences.


- `transfer_queue_ids` : string array

	Enables transferring customers to the specified queues.

Message types
-------------

The server treats message types prefixed with "ninchat.com/" differently from
others: only the ones documented here are accepted by the server.  Messages
with other kind of message types are passed through without any additional
processing.


### `ninchat.com/file`

The payload consists of a single part with a JSON object containing the
following properties:

- `text` : string (optional)
- `files` : object list

The `files` list contains one or more objects with the following properties:

- `file_id` : string
- `file_attrs` : string


### `ninchat.com/info/*`

Info messages record relevant events in dialogue or channel history.  They are
generated by the server; ones sent by the client are rejected.  The payload
consists of a single part with a JSON object.  The object's properties depend
on the specific message type, as described below.

#### `ninchat.com/info/user`

- `user_id` : string
- `user_name` : string (optional)
- `user_name_old` : string (optional)

single part with a JSON object containing properties described below.

- `name` : string
- `size` : integer
- `icon` : string
- `url` : string
- `thumbnail` : string (optional)

This message type is no longer supported by official Ninchat client
implementations; any link messages will be ignored by them.


### `ninchat.com/metadata`

The payload consists of a single part with a JSON object containing the
following properties:

- `data` : object
- `time` : float (optional)

If `time` is specified, it overrides the `message_time` property of the
`message_received` event.  (It is used to indicate that the metadata change
happened some time before messaging was initiated.)


### `ninchat.com/notice`

Similar to `ninchat.com/text` (described below), but may only be sent to
channels, and only by channel operators.


### `ninchat.com/rtc/*`

	{ answer: false, busy: false, unsupported: true }

	
### `ninchat.com/text`

Text messages are the basic message type, sent by clients.  The payload
consists of a single part with a JSON object containing a `text` property
(string):

	{"text":"This is the content of the message."}


### `ninchat.com/ui/*`

UI messages add user interaction to conversation.  The payload consists of a
single part.


#### `ninchat.com/ui/action`

The payload is a JSON object with the following properties:

- `action` : string

	Currently only "click" is supported.

- `target` : object

	`ninchat.com/ui/compose` object which triggered the interaction.

	If the `element` was "select" in the compose message, the selected options
	will have an additional `selected` property with value true.


#### `ninchat.com/ui/compose`

The payload is a JSON array with at least one object; its properties:

- `class` : string (optional)

	Behaves like its HTML counterpart, but the number of classes is limited to
	5.

- `element` : string

	Currently "a", "button" and "select" are supported.

- `href` : string (optional)

	Behaves like its HTML counterpart when `element` is set as "a"

- `id` : string (optional)

	Behaves exactly as its HTML counterpart.

- `label` : string (optional)

	A label or a descriptive text depending on the element.  In other words
	label is text in the button etc.

- `options` : object array (optional)

	Enumerates the options of a "select" element.  Each object must have the
	`label` and `value` properties (strings).

- `name` : string (optional)

	Behaves exactly as its HTML counterpart.

It is highly encouraged to set some of `class`, `id` and `name`, in order to
determine which UI element was interacted with when `ninchat.com/ui/action` is
received.

Note that Ninchat web client prefixes `id`, `name` and each `class` with
"nui-ext-".  E.g. if "button ok" `class` string is set, it will be rendered as
class="nui-ext-button nui-ext-ok" in Ninchat web client.


Audience metadata
-----------------

Custom key-value pairs may be set via the `audience_metadata` action parameter,
or by sending a [`ninchat.com/metadata`](#ninchatcommetadata) message to an
audience channel or dialogue.  Some metadata keys have predefined meanings, and
are used by Ninchat if set in a specific way:


### `rating`

An integer between -1 and 1.  Set by the requester of the audience by sending a
[`ninchat.com/metadata`](#ninchatcommetadata) message.


### `secure`

See the [`request_audience`](#request_audience) action for details.


### `tag_ids`

String array containing tag identifiers.  Set by the acceptor of the audience
by sending a [`ninchat.com/metadata`](#ninchatcommetadata) message.  Used in
queue statistics.


### `vars`

Object containing key-value pairs (string values).  Set by the requester of the
audience via the [`request_audience`](#request_audience) action.  Used in queue
statistics.


Streaming Transports
====================

Both supported transport types support an initial service discovery step:

Before making a WebSocket connection or initiating HTTP long polling, the
client may discover a direct address by making a HTTP GET request to
`https://api.ninchat.com/v2/endpoint`.  The response contains a JSON object, or
a JavaScript statement (JSONP) if the `callback` query parameter is specified.
The object contains the `hosts` property (string array).  The client should try
the hosts in order until a transport connection succeeds.  The hosts array
shouldn't be used permanently; a fresh array must be requested when a new
session is to be created, or after looping through the array unsuccessfully for
a time.

A client implementation may choose to omit the service discovery step (e.g. for
simplicity) and use the `api.ninchat.com` hostname for transport connections.


WebSocket
---------

The URL format is `wss://HOST/v2/socket`, where `HOST` is an address aquired
during the service discovery step.  The WebSocket subprotocol is `ninchat.com`.

Actions and events consist of one or more frames.  The first one is a text
frame containing a JSON object with the `action` or `event` property (string),
the optional `frames` property (integer) and the parameter properties (see
Interface).  `resume_session` and `close_session`&mdash;when it is the initial
action&mdash;must contain the `session_id` property (string).  Any action may
also contain the latest received `event_id` (integer) to acknowledge events.

If `frames` is set and greater than 0, it specifies how many subsequent frames
form the payload.

The initial action on a connection must be `create_session`, `resume_session`,
`close_session` or one supporting sessionless operation.  A given connection
can't be used to open a new session after the `close_session` action and the
session can't be changed during a connection.

The client and the server may send empty (keep-alive) frames between
actions/events.  They should be ignored by the peer.

The frames may be text or binary.  Even if the client expects a frame
containing JSON or other text-based data, it must be able to handle binary
framing.


### Examples

Service discovery:

	GET /v2/endpoint HTTP/1.1
	Host: api.ninchat.com

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/json

	{
	  "hosts": ["192-0-43-10.ninchat.com", "192-0-43-11.ninchat.com"]
	}

...

Sent WebSocket frame:

	{
	  "action":       "send_message",
	  "action_id":    2,
	  "channel_id":   "04jqf8db",
	  "message_type": "ninchat.com/text",
	  "event_id":     6,
	  "frames":       1
	}

Sent WebSocket frame:

	{"text":"Gold Five to Red Leader; lost Tiree, lost Dutch."}

Received WebSocket frame:

	{
	  "event":             "message_received",
	  "action_id":         2,
	  "channel_id":        "04jqf8db",
	  "message_id":        "0fb74jl5",
	  "message_time":      1320846070,
	  "message_type":      "ninchat.com/text",
	  "message_user_id":   "05kq2htc",
	  "message_user_name": "Vance",
	  "event_id":          7,
	  "frames":            1
	}

Received WebSocket frame:

	{"text":"Gold Five to Red Leader; lost Tiree, lost Dutch."}


HTTP long polling
-----------------

The URL format is `https://HOST/v2/poll` (excluding query parameters), where
`HOST` is an address aquired during the service discovery step.

Actions and events consist of a single object containing an `action` or `event`
property (string), the optional `payload` property and the parameter properties
(see [Interface](#interface)).  Actions must also contain the `session_id`
property (string) when documentation doesn't state otherwise.  The
`resume_session` action should also contain the latest received `event_id`
(integer) to acknowledge events.

If `payload` is specified, its value represents a single-part payload.
Multi-part and JSON-incompatible payloads are not supported.  (Long poll
clients should accept only known JSON-based message types.)

The action object is provided in the `data` query parameter of a GET request
and the name of a JavaScript function is provided in the `callback` query
parameter.  The response body contains JavaScript code which invokes the
callback function with an array of event objects as a parameter.

`create_session` requests are responded to with an event specific to it
(providing the `session_id` needed for the other actions).  `resume_session`
requests block until there are asynchronous events to return or a timeout
occurs.  Other (well-formed) action requests get an empty response immediately;
any reply events are delivered by way of `resume_session`.


### Examples

Service discovery:

	GET /v2/endpoint?callback=connect HTTP/1.1
	Host: api.ninchat.com

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK

	}]);


Sessionless HTTP Calling
========================

The call API supports a subset of the [Interface](#interface): the actions
which are practical without a connection-oriented transport may be invoked with
a HTTP request (without setting up long polling).  The
`https://api.ninchat.com/v2/call` URL may be accessed using GET and POST
methods, with `application/json`, `application/x-protobuf` and
`application/octet-stream` content types.

Actions and events use a JSON-encoded header (object) containing at least an
`action` or `event` property (string) and the parameter properties (see
[Interface](#interface)).  The `action_id` parameter may be omitted from
actions.  Events won't include the `event_id` parameter.


Requests
--------

Most actions require authentication (due to the lack of sessions):

1. The `caller_id` and `caller_auth` properties (strings) specify user agent
   login credentials.

2. The `caller_type`, `caller_name` and `caller_auth` properties (strings)
   specify identity credentials.  Currently only the "email" identity type is
   supported.

When the GET method or the POST method with `application/json` content type is
used, actions may also contain the `payload` property.  If specified, its value
represents a single-part payload.  Multi-part and JSON-incompatible payloads
are supported when using the POST method with `application/octet-stream`
content type.

POST content may be compressed with `deflate` (zlib) or `gzip` as the
`Content-Encoding`.


### GET

The `data` query parameter contains the action header with optional payload.

Example:

	GET /v2/call?data=%7B%22caller_id%22%3A%220ebbjg1g%22%2C%22caller_auth%
	22%3A%222634d03q1tkt0%22%2C%22action%22%3A%22join_channel%22%2C%22chann
	el_id%22%3A%2204jqf8db%22%7D HTTP/1.1
	Host: api.ninchat.com


### POST application/json

The request body contains the action header with optional payload.

Example:

	POST /v2/call HTTP/1.1
	Host: api.ninchat.com
	Content-Type: application/json

	{
	  "caller_id":   "0ebbjg1g",
	  "caller_auth": "2634d03q1tkt0",
	  "action":      "send_message",
	  "payload":     {"text":"hello world"},
	  ...
	}


### POST application/octet-stream

The request body contains the action header and payload parts using a binary
frame encoding similar to
[WebSocket](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.2): each frame is
preceded by encoded frame size consisting of 1, 3 or 9 bytes:

- Sizes up to and including 125 are encoded as a single byte.

- Sizes 126-65535 are encoded as a byte with value 126, followed by two bytes
  with the size in network byte order (big endian).

- Sizes 65536 and up are encoded as a byte with value 127, followed by eight
  bytes with the size in network byte order (big endian).  The most significant
  bit of the eight-byte value must be zero; the (theoretical) maximum size can
  be represented by a signed 64-bit integer type.

Note that the most significant bit of the first byte must be zero.

Example:

	POST /v2/call HTTP/1.1
	Host: api.ninchat.com
	Content-Type: application/octet-stream

	\x52{"caller_id":"0ebbjg1g","caller_auth":"2634d03q1tkt0","action":"sen
	d_message",...}\x16{"text":"hello world"}


Responses
---------

The content type is chosen from the request's `Accept` header using the
following algorithm:

1. If there is only one event, it doesn't have a payload, and
   `application/json` is accepted, it is used.

2. If the event has a payload or there are multiple events, and
   `application/x-protobuf` is accepted, it is used.

3. If only one of `application/json`, `application/x-protobuf` and
   `application/octet-stream` is specified, it is used.  This may result in an
   incomplete response.

4. If no supported content types are accepted, the response will contain no
   data.

Support for additional content types may be added in the future, so using
wildcards in the `Accept` header (e.g. `*/*` or `application/*`) may suddenly
cause a response which the client can't handle.

Responses may contain one or more events, depending on the action.  In case of
an error, the "error" event is always the first one.


### application/json

The response body contains a single event header.  (Note that a payload is not
supported.)

Example:

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/json

	{
	  "event":      "channel_joined",
	  "channel_id": "04jqf8db",
	  ...
	}


### application/x-protobuf

The response body contains a serialized
[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) message.
It is the `Response` message defined in [`call.proto`](call.proto); it supports
multiple events and payloads.

Example:

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/x-protobuf

	\x0a\x60\x0a\x5e{"channel_id":"103uok1j","message_id":"38f8589h","event
	":"history_results","history_length":1}\x0a\xcd\x01\x0a\xb7\x01{"histor
	y_length":0,"event":"message_received","channel_id":"103uok1j","message
	_user_id":"38f829b","message_time":1445514364,"message_type":"ninchat.c
	om/text","message_id":"38f8589h"}\x0a\x11{"text": "hello"}'


### application/octet-stream

The response body uses the same encoding as the corresponding request content
type, but currently only a single frame is supported.
